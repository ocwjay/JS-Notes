//WHILE LOOPS
//You will want to use this when you arent sure when the condition will be met
//for instance, I want to walk to the wall. I dont know how many steps it takes to get there, I just need to get there with however manmy steps needed.

//while(condition){what to do as long as the condition is true}
//loop ends when the condition is false

var num = 0;
while(num <= 5){
    console.log(num);
    num++;
}
//this will print the value of num to the console and increment num by 1 until it equals 5.
